# Projects from CS 144 Advanced Data Structures
This repo contains all of the labs and major projects from CS144 Advanced Data Structures with an overview of them all here
- Labs:
  - [Lab1-BSTTraversal](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab1-BSTTraversal): Simple program to perform in order and pre order traversals on a given binary tree
  - [Lab2-BSTOperations](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab2-BSTOperations): Code to create an unbalanced binary tree using given node values
  - [Lab3-BSTDeletion](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab3-BSTDeletions): Code to delete nodes from an unbalanced binary tree
  - [Lab4-BSTPractice](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab4-BSTPractice): Binary Search Tree balancing implementation using ArrayList sort and some helper functions
  - [Lab5-AVLTreeInsertion](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab5-AVLTreeInsertion): Self balancing AVL binary search tree insertion implementation
  - [Lab6-Trie](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab6-Trie): Trie data structure implementation for matching strings
  - [Lab7-PriorityQueue](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab7-PriorityQueue): Priority Queue implemented with a heap
  - [Lab8-Skiplist](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab8-Skiplist): Probabilistic skiplist data structure implementation
  - [Lab9-GraphImplementation](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Lab9-GraphImplementation): Implementation of directed graph data structure
- Projects:
  - [Project1-BSTGUI](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Project1-BSTGUI): A JavaFX GUI based application that allows you to examine the operations and performance of different types of binary search trees
  - [Project2-Trie-HuffmanEncoding](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Project2-Trie-HuffmanEncoding): Two separate projects, a simple Trie implementation and a Huffman Encoding implementation using HashMaps
  - [Project3-Dijkstra](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/Project3-Dijkstra): Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm implementation using a PriorityQueue
  - [FinalProject-TaskManagementSystem](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CS144/FinalProject-TaskManagementSystem): A text based task management system that supports multiple projects with regular and priority tasks. You can create projects or tasks, display projects, edit tasks, delete projects or tasks, and sort projects alphabetically or by size.
